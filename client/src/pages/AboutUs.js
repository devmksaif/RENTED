      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>Welcome to RENTED! We are a platform dedicated to making renting easy, accessible, and sustainable. Our mission is to connect people who need items temporarily with those who have items to rent, fostering a community built on sharing and trust.</p>
      <p>Founded in [Year], RENTED started with the simple idea that many items we own sit idle most of the time. By creating a marketplace for renting, we help people save money, reduce waste, and discover new things.</p>
      <p>Join our community and start renting or lending today!</p>
